# Basic RPG

---

# Summary

*Incomplete* 

Built a basic RPG browser-based game using Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and Ruby. Other tech included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX. 

My main goals for this project was to build something cool, learn more about web development and programming, and have fun doing it.

Challenges include correctly utilizing the tools I have a basic understanding of and furthering my experience with each of the tools.

My plans as of now is to use this Basic RPG as a stepping stone to building a more unique RPG afterwards. I want to use this project as a skeleton for my future idea.

Built with RESTful routing in mind. Agile methodology was used for the creation of this project. 


# Goals

* Get comfortable using ActiveRecord and Sinatra.
* Utilize Ruby for basic algorithms.
* Learn about jQuery and AJAX and utilize them for better UX and visuals.
* Learn JavaScript and how to best utilize this language in this and future projects.
